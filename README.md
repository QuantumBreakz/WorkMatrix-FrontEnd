## 🧑‍💻 Usage

- **Login:** Employees and admins log in with their Supabase credentials.
- **Dashboard:** Employees see their own activity, screenshots, and app usage. Admins see all users (if permitted by RLS).
- **Requests:** Admins can approve or reject employee requests.
- **Settings:** Users can update their profile and preferences.

---

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

- **No raw media is stored in the frontend.** Only summary data and metadata are displayed.
- **Role-based access:** Enforced via Supabase RLS and frontend logic.
- **Environment variables:** Never commit secrets; use `.env.local` for local development.

---

## 🧩 Extending the Frontend

- **Add new pages:** Create files in `app/` for new routes.
- **Add new components:** Place reusable UI in `components/`.
- **API integration:** Use `lib/supabase.ts` for all Supabase queries.
- **Type safety:** Use TypeScript types from `types/`.

---

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

- **Blank page or errors:** Check the browser console and terminal output.
- **Auth issues:** Ensure Supabase credentials are correct and RLS policies are set.
- **API errors:** Check Supabase logs and network requests.
- **Styling issues:** Run `npm run lint` and `npm run format`.

---

## 📦 Deployment

- **Vercel:** Recommended for Next.js. Connect your repo and set environment variables.
- **Other platforms:** Any Node.js-compatible host will work.
